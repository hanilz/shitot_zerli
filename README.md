### By: Hanil Zarbailov, Yana Raitsin, Dolev Almog, Eitan German, Yael Shustin

This repository serves as the official codebase for our mid-degree project that is Zerli Flower Shop.

This project is the product of a combination of 3 courses at Ort Braude College of Engineering, Karmiel, Israel during the 5th semester of our BSc. Software Engineering degree studies.

The courses were: 
- Introduction to Software Testing (מבוא לבדיקות תוכנה)
- Enginnering Methodologies for Software Systems Development (שיטות הנדסיות לפיתוח מערכות תוכנה)
- User Interface/ User Experience UI/UX (ממשק אדם מחשב)

## Description
Zerli Flower Shop is a Java Desktop Application that simulates a flower shop. 

We support many different user-roles, like customers, managers, workers, delivery coordinator and more.

It uses an OCSF client-server framework that establishes a TCP connection between a client and the server.

JavaFX with SceneBuilder were used to design and develop the UI/UX of the application.

MySQL with JDBC served as the database for this project.

Junit and Mockito were used to maintain a testing infrastructure and write comprehensive unit tests.
